            </h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to our platform ‚Äî where code, creativity, and community come together.
            </p>
            <p>
                In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, the ability to prototype, test, and share front-end code instantly is not just a convenience ‚Äî it's a necessity.
                Our platform was created with one core belief: coding should be accessible, inspiring, and collaborative. Whether you're just learning your first line of HTML, or you're a seasoned developer refining a complex animation, this is your space to experiment, to showcase, and to grow.
            </p>

                üîß What We Offer
            </h3>
            <p>
                We provide a live coding environment that allows users to write and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-time. With no installations or configurations required, you can jump straight into building. Our editor is fast, intuitive, and designed for creativity.
                It supports everything from basic prototypes to advanced UI experiments, empowering users to explore ideas and test concepts with ease.
            </p>
            <p>
                But we're more than just a tool. We're a thriving community of makers, designers, developers, and learners who come together to share code, get feedback, and inspire each other. You can explore thousands of public creations, fork and remix them, or build something entirely your own.
                Whether you're building a simple form layout or an advanced web animation, there's always room to learn, improve, and connect.
            </p>

                üí° Why We Exist
            </h3>
            <p>
                We believe in learning by doing. Tutorials are great, but nothing beats the experience of writing your own code and seeing it work live. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve built this platform to support experimentation without fear. Mistakes aren‚Äôt just accepted here ‚Äî they‚Äôre celebrated as part of the learning process.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also believe that coding should be social. Our platform isn‚Äôt about coding in isolation ‚Äî it's about sharing, discovering, and growing together. We provide tools to publish your work, embed it in blogs or portfolios, and collaborate with others in real-time.
            </p>

                üåç Our Mission
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our mission is to democratize front-end development. We want to lower the barrier to entry for anyone who wants to learn how to build for the web. From students and hobbyists to professional designers and developers, everyone deserves a space where they can write code freely and learn at their own pace.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and inspiring environment for coders of all levels. We envision a world where anyone ‚Äî regardless of background, location, or experience ‚Äî can express themselves through the language of code.
            </p>
